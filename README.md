**Problem motivation.** As the industry has reached peak computational centralization, compute needs communication to scale through distributed 
computing. There is a need to have a forum to discuss how the two sides of the same coin (compute and communication) can be exposed to the 
application to make efficient service placement and selection decisions. This is especially important at the edge of the network, 
where services such as distributed AI, XR/VR, vehicle networks (V2X), etc. need this compute and communication information to be 
efficiently deployed and managed. Exposed information should also account for the application footprint reaching out to cellular 
networks and for trust capabilities exposure. 

The agenda for this meeting will include talks and discussions covering the following topics:

- Compute information exposure for service placement and selection.
- Cellular information exposure to Internet applications.
- Security information exposure for trust modelling and measurement.
- Southbound mechanisms to obtain network and compute information.
- IETF WGs GAP Analysis.
